## Description

This project aims to build predictive models to forecast patient outcomes based on a COVID-19 dataset. The primary goals are to predict:
1. **Intubation Needs**: Determine whether a patient will require intubation.
2. **ICU Admission**: Assess the likelihood of a patient needing to be admitted to the ICU.
3. **Mortality Outcome**: Predict whether a patient will survive or not.

The models utilize machine learning techniques to aid in resource planning, capacity management, and treatment strategy development by providing valuable insights into patient outcomes.

## Summary of Questions and Answers

**1. Can we predict whether a patient will need intubation?**  
   *Answer*: Yes, using a Random Forest classifier, we can predict intubation needs with high accuracy. The model helps in planning and prioritizing patient care.

**2. Can we predict whether a patient will need to be admitted to the ICU?**  
   *Answer*: Yes, our model effectively predicts ICU admissions, which can assist in managing hospital capacity and early intervention.

**3. Can we predict the mortality outcome of a patient?**  
   *Answer*: Yes, the Random Forest classifier predicts mortality outcomes with substantial accuracy, aiding in the development of treatment strategies.

## Application of This Knowledge

The insights gained from these predictive models are crucial for:
- **Resource Planning**: Allocating medical resources and personnel effectively.
- **Capacity Management**: Optimizing ICU and hospital bed usage.
- **Early Intervention**: Identifying patients who may need immediate attention.
- **Treatment Strategy Development**: Tailoring treatments based on predicted outcomes.
